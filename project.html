	<h1> WHAT IS THE INTERACTION? </h1>
	<h2><i> AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT</i></h2>
	<br> <br>
	<p>Often without even realizing it humans use hand gestures every day. They are often a subconscious form of communication that is used to enhance the information being conveyed. They are an essential part of our communication with each other aswell as a useful tool for getting ideas across. When accommodated into design, designers must consider peoples hand gestures when giving presentations and conveying ideas. Because of their importance many designers such as user interface and 3D animators have done research to replicate these gestures to make their designs as realistic as possible.

<p> These are the most commonly used hand gestures. The hand gestures shown are usually  imperative actions, meaning they help instruct people on what the person wants them to do. However this is not always the case. Particulary in design hand gestures are an important part of the user interface/ experience. They must study the exact nature of a swipe of a human hand in order to make the link of the interaction from human to technology Although they all have different meanings, they are often able to be understood by alot of cultures around the world. </p>
